# Code for San Mateo

## What is Code for San Mateo?

Code for San Mateo is a brigade of Code for America, dedicated toward providing a forum where citizens interested in their communities can use technology to address civic issues with the help of their fellow citizens and to collaborate with members of local government and issue groups.

Code for San Mateo focused on issues pertinent toward San Mateo County, and is open to anyone who is interested in contributing toward the civic welfare of the country, regardless of experience with technology.

## Code of Conduct

Last Updated: 1/5/2016

The Code for America community expects that OpenSMC activities and events:

1. Are a safe and respectful environment for all participants.
2. Are a place where people are free to fully express their identities.
3. Presume the value of others. Everyone’s ideas, skills, and contributions have value.
4. Don’t assume everyone has the same context, and encourage questions.
5. Find a way for people to be productive with their skills (technical and not) and energy. Use language such as “yes/and”, not “no/but.”
6. Encourage members and participants to listen as much as they speak.
7. Strive to build tools that are open and free technology for public use. Activities that aim to foster public use, not for private gain, are prioritized.
8. Prioritize access for and input from those who are traditionally excluded from the civic process.
9. Work to ensure that all demographics present in the community are represented.
10. Actively involve community groups and those with subject matter expertise in the decision-making process.
11. Ensure that the relationships and conversations between community members, the local government staff and community partners remain respectful, participatory, and productive.
12. Provide an environment where people are not subjected to discrimination or harassment.

OpenSMC reserves the right to ask anyone in violation of these policies not to participate in OpenSMC events or network activities.
